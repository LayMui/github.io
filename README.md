# About Me

I am a software developer with focus in testing.

Microsoft has a term of such role called SDET.

I have 20+ years experience in QA dev, test automation (API, web, mobile, backend database testing)

I hope to share my experience and knowledge to the QA testing community and help them see the value that they bring to any organisation they are working in.

Here is my personal mission statement: A highly effective quality-driven value-added QA professional to make team do things more efficiently and make work life a enjoyable and productive one!
